          <h2>About Me:<img id="about-me-img" src="Images/IMG_8318.jpg" alt="Picture of my family"></h2>
            <p>  I am an adventurous homebody. I am a friendly introvert. I love order and also chaos. Sometimes I need to go to the mountains, sometimes the ocean. I like to read, travel, do outdoors stuff, and make things.
            I currently live in Portland, Oregon with my husband, our two kids, a feral housecat, and four chickens.
            I have spent most of my working life in the hospitality industry waiting tables and a few other guest-facing roles, as well as some admin and finance work. I was also fortunate enough to stay home with my two children from my son's birth until my daughter went to kindergarten. My current role is processing payroll in the finance department of the Portland Hilton. I'm ready to do something new.
            I am learning to code at <strong>Epicodus</strong> because I want to learn a new skill which is both marketable professionally and interesting personally. I enjoy language and logic, so it's working out great.</p>
